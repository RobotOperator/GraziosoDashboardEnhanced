# GraziosoDashboardEnhanced
My enhancements of the Grazioso Dashboard for the first artifact of CS499.

##About the Project/Project Title
Grazioso Salvare Dashboard â€“ This dashboard operates as a user interface to interact with data stored in a MongoDB database using a PHP browser interface that also utilizes PHP endpoints as a middleware for interacting with the database. The dashboard facilitates a web interface to view the records retrieved based on filtering and interactions with the widgets and can be adapted to present data for a variety of different datasets.
